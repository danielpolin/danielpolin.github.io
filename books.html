<p>These are the books I read in 2016. Please feel free to read my reviews and let me know if you have any comments or critiques. I'd be happy to discuss them with you.</p>
<h2>Uprooted - Naomi Novik</h2>
<h2>Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth - Apostolos Doxiadis</h2>
<p>Logicomix is a graphic novel exploration of the life and work of Bertrand Russell.  I think that the format of the novel is well made and enjoyable to read. It uses a nested story narrative of the comic writers explaining their process of creating a story in which Bertrand Russell gives a talk about his life and views on passivism. I do think that the narrative does oversimplify the idea of mathematical rigor and incompleteness. I fear that many people may come away from the novel thinking that either math is completely self-consistent, or that it is completely disproven for practical implications. But despite this, and some historical inaccuracies, this book does a good job of explaining some difficult or traditionally convoluted topics at a level approachable to anyone. 6/10</p>
<h2>The Old Man and the Sea - Earnest Hemingway</h2>
<p>The Old Man and the Sea was a striking story about the struggle and futility of life. I really think that Hemingway really has a gift for subtle symbolism and in a realistic setting. I can't help but compare this book to the Alchemist and Of Mice and Men since I read them both recently. I think this book has a much more realistic and useful outlook on reality that the uselessly optimistic Alchemist. It is hard to pick favorites between the Old Man and the Sea and Of Mice and Men. I think the contrast is that the Old Man and the Sea deals with the struggles of life and Of Mice and Men deals with the futility of mortality and death. 7.5/10</p>

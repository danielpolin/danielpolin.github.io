<p>These are the books I read in 2016. Please feel free to read my reviews and let me know if you have any comments, critiques, or recommendations. I'd be happy to discuss them with you.</p>
<h2>The Clockwork Rocket - Greg Egan</h2>
<p>The Clockwork Rocket has a fairly simple premise: what if time acted just like any other dimension? Starting from there the book has its positives and negatives. Egan creates an interesting and thought provoking world that he used to evaluate pertinent issues like women’s rights, especially reproductive rights. But on the other hand he also often interrupts the narrative to give basic science lessons. I think it is one of the trademarks of good science fiction to have the world and all science involved to be discovered fluidly through story. If you ever have to stop the story to explain something science or background related then the narrative structure and the novel suffers. Unfortunately this book does this time and time again in a way that lacks fluidity. The book also focuses greatly on simple scientific ideas while leaving the actual science necessary to back up his world largely unexplained. Most distressingly, he fails to properly explain why he thinks changing a basic assumption of relativity, the non-constant speed of light, would have only the seemingly mundane changes he mentions. I also don’t understand why he believes his world would have a reversed form of time dilation when time dilation itself is based on the fixed speed of light. If time were just another dimension then we should logically only have Galilean transformations. 5/10 </p>
<h2>The Dead Mountaineer's Inn - Arkady and Boris Strugatsky</h2>
<p>The Dead Mountaineer’s Inn is a true work of Russian absurdist science fiction. It is written in a way that there are constantly things happening but none of them really have any meaning. I think the best word to describe this book is, “bizarre.” It's well written, but bizarre. 6/10</p>
<h2>Uprooted - Naomi Novik</h2>
<p>I think one of the main hallmarks of a great fantasy novel is believability. A fantasy novel needs to make you believe that everything within a fanciful universe is convincing and seemingly rationally coherent. It must make the incredible seem credible. Uprooted does this splendidly. When reading this book you can believe in the magic in a way that I remember feeling when I read great works of fantasy like “A Wizard of Earthsea.” This book is also a coming of age story of a girl trying to make her own way in a world that clashes with and rejects the way she operates. In her journey we are led along the mystery of a dark, evil wood that is revealed as Agnieszka finds her own way and comes to accept and take advantage of her own unique talents. 7.5/10 </p>
<h2>Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth - Apostolos Doxiadis</h2>
<p>Logicomix is a graphic novel exploration of the life and work of Bertrand Russell.  I think that the format of the novel is well made and enjoyable to read. It uses a nested story narrative of the comic writers explaining their process of creating a story in which Bertrand Russell gives a talk about his life and views on passivism. I do think that the narrative does oversimplify the idea of mathematical rigor and incompleteness. I fear that many people may come away from the novel thinking that either math is completely self-consistent, or that it is completely disproven for practical implications. But despite this, and some historical inaccuracies, this book does a good job of explaining some difficult or traditionally convoluted topics at a level approachable to anyone. 6/10</p>
<h2>The Old Man and the Sea - Earnest Hemingway</h2>
<p>The Old Man and the Sea was a striking story about the struggle and futility of life. I really think that Hemingway really has a gift for subtle symbolism and in a realistic setting. I can't help but compare this book to the Alchemist and Of Mice and Men since I read them both recently. I think this book has a much more realistic and useful outlook on reality that the uselessly optimistic Alchemist. It is hard to pick favorites between the Old Man and the Sea and Of Mice and Men. I think the contrast is that the Old Man and the Sea deals with the struggles of life and Of Mice and Men deals with the futility of mortality and death. 8/10</p>
<h2>The End of Eternity - Isaac Asimov</h2>
<p> The End of Eternity is a pretty solid standalone novel and also can be seen as tying into Asimov’s larger galactic empire universe. However, this universe does seem to have sentient life other than that of Earth, whereas the Galactic Empire universe does not.  It chronicles the adventure of a single member of the collective timeline enforcement agency known as “Eternity.” The story follows the ark of an individual member of this society as he attempts to serve his community without compromising his humanity. I think this story has an interesting take on time travel and the dynamics thereof and is worth reading based on this alone. If we do ever discover a means of time travel I think we will inevitably form some type of policing system like Eternity to alter the timeline if that is possible. 7/10</p>
<h2>Of Mice and Men - John Steinbeck</h2>
<h2>Lyra's Oxford - Philip Pullman</h2>
<h2>Call of Cthulhu - H.P. Lovecraft</h2>
<h2>A Wild Sheep Chase - Haruki Murakami</h2>
<h2>The Dispatcher - John Scalzi</h2>
<h2>The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho</h2>
		<p>It's like Candide but written with no sense of irony. 5.5/10</p>
<h2>The Ocean at the End of the Lane - Neil Gaiman</h2>
<h2>Till We Have Faces - C.S. Lewis</h2>
<h2>The Green Futures of Tycho - William Sleator</h2>
<h2>Doctor Who: Time Lord Fairy Tales - Justin Richards</h2>
<h2>Robots & Empire - Isaac Asimov</h2>
<h2>All the Light We Cannot See - Anthony Doerr</h2>
<h2>Ishmael - Daniel Quinn</h2>
<h2>Ringworld - Larry Niven</h2>
<h2>Flowers for Algernon - Daniel Keyes</h2>
<h2>Starship Titanic - Douglas Adams</h2>
<h2>Night - Elie Wiesel</h2>
<h2>The Robots of Dawn - Isaac Asimov</h2>
<h2>The Naked Sun - Isaac Asimov</h2>
<h2>The Caves of Steel - Isaac Asimov</h2>
<h2>The Gods Themselves - Isaac Asimov</h2>
<h2>Ivan the Fool - Leo Tolstoy</h2>
<h2>Coraline - Neil Gaiman</h2>
<h2>American Gods - Neil Gaiman</h2>
<h2>Snow Crash - Neil Stephenson</h2>
<h2>The Once and Future King - T. H. White</h2>
<h2>Mort - Terry Pratchett</h2>
<h2>The Dispossessed - Ursula K. Le Guin</h2>
<p>I thought that the Dispossessed was very successful in both its main plot and in the moral and philosophical conversation it was trying to create. It might be that I personally relate to the fact that the main character is a physicist, but it also is a pointed piece about types of government systems, their strengths and failures. It is called "An Ambiguous Utopia" because even when any one of the societies seems to be almost perfect, there are always shortcomings and for that reason a simple change in viewpoint could entirely change what you take away from this book. We also see how gender roles come into play in these societies. This is even more interesting when you consider that it is being written in 1974 by arguably the greatest female science fiction writer of all time. 9/10</p>
<h2>Good Omens - Neil Gaiman/Terry Pratchett</h2>
<h2>Once Upon a Time in the North - Philip Pullman</h2>
<h2>Equal Rites - Terry Pratchett</h2>
<h2>I Am Not Spock - Leonard Nimoy</h2>
<h2>The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Notre Dame de Paris) - Victor Hugo</h2>
<h2>Don Quixote De La Mancha - Miguel De Cervantes</h2>
<h2>The L-Shaped Room - Lynne Reid Banks</h2>
<p>Lynne Reid Banks is one of the most realistic writers that I have encountered. Even when writing about the most fantasy subjects she still makes the characters act and feel like real people. This is the first adult novel I read by her and it is extremely well done. The L-Shaped Room is about a young, unmarried woman named Jane who becomes pregnant in the 1950’s.  It is a very realistic telling that give great insight into the times and mores of its setting.  The narrative doesn’t cut out the casual racism and antisemitism of the 50’s, although it is obviously told from a perspective that is in support of equality. It even somewhat supports homosexuality which wasn’t in vogue on the 50’s or early 1960 when the book was written. It does have some caricaturish depictions of race, but this is somewhat to be expected for the times and even somewhat excusable as we are seeing the world through the lens of a contemporary, Jane. This in particular is what makes the book great, the vantage of being inside Jane’s mind and her truly human interactions in a world that denigrates her. 8.5/10</p>

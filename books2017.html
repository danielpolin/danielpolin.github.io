<p>These are the books I read in 2017. Please feel free to read my reviews and let me know if you have any comments, critiques, or recommendations. I'd be happy to discuss them with you.</p>

<h2>Too Like the Lightning - Ada Palmer</h2>
<p>This new and violent rendition of The Indian in the Cupboard takes place in a futuristic world where governments are replaced by voluntarily joined groups and corporations. Although it is a futuristic world, I have trouble calling this book science fiction. It is a fantasy novel taking place in the future, but without the adequate explanation of the times it fails to make the leap to attain the feasibility that Sci-Fi necessitates. What’s more, its ending is wholly unsatisfactory, as if has no conclusion or even the less acceptable cliff hanger. It was clearly purposefully designed to be an extremely intellectual novel, full of classical references and enlightenment philosophy. Sadly this comes off more as snobbish than intelligent, especially from the narrative viewpoint of the villain, Mycroft Canner. The world presented did have an interesting portrayal of gender, with the abolition of gendered pronouns. But again, the narrator uses gendered pronouns, and in such a way that they don’t apply to the actual sex of the character which obfuscates visualization of such characters. This is not a flaw of the book however. It is an active choice of the author. Great title as well. 6/10</p>
<h2>Dreams of a Final Theory - Steven Weinberg</h2>
<p>This book is a great read for anyone who is interested in learning some of the problems of modern day physics. As with all of these types of books, it often falls beneath the scope of actual rigorous explanations, but it serves its purpose well. 6/10</p>
<h2>The Handmaid's Tale - Margaret Atwood</h2>
<p>The Handmaid’s Tale was a well crafted novel that rekindles the feeling of reading 1984 for the first time. It is a dystopia told from the perspective of a woman in a religious breeding camp. The novel does give us a certain level of closure that we never got in other Orwellian works. That is we are told afterwards that the rest of the world still exists, that there is still hope that the dystopia ends in time. 7.5/10</p>
<h2>Shadows of the Empire - Steve Perry</h2>
<p>Shadows of the Empire is the first, and likely last Star Wars novel I am likely to read. It has relative renowned compared to others in the series because of the advertising, and accompanying soundtrack that they created for the novel. The basically made everything but the movie. The problem is that it is exactly what I expected from a Star Wars novel; that is, not very good, and basically parodying the franchise. It takes place in between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and as such they don’t have Han. Their solution, in stead of giving larger, developing roles to other characters, it to replace him with a cheap knockoff. They also choose to make Leia a side character who doesn’t have the same sense of command or cleverness from the series. Basically it seems like this book was made as a filler to make money, which it was. 5.5/10 </p>
<h2>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman - Richard Feynman</h2>
<p>This book has become a sort of rite of passage for physics students, so I thought I would finally read it. It is an accumulation of the stories of renowned physicist Richard Feynman. Many of this are very entertaining and undoubtedly imagined to some degree, but what holds true is their reinforcement of Feynman’s views on education and creative thought which are definitely worth reading. It is also interesting to see what Feynman finds important in stories and what he chooses to keep and what to leave out. 7/10 <p>
<h2>The Screwtape Letters - C.S. Lewis</h2>
<p>I hate propaganda but I recognize the potential workmanship of its form. The Screwtape Letters are very cleverly crafted in that they are presented from the perspective of a demon advising his underlings on how to corrupt people. This therefore allows Lewis to say whatever he wants and rally Christianity behind a vaguely established common narrative. If Lewis makes a point through his devil’s advocate that the reader agrees with, then the reader can feel self assured because of the common opinion. If the reader disagrees with Lewis’ sometimes hypocritical, and often misogynistic viewpoints, they can be dismissed because they are presented from the viewpoint of a demon, and of course, demons are misleading and are obviously lying. It’s a very clever propaganda device to make Christians feel superior regardless of if they agree with the points made or not. 5/10</p>
<h2>Hannibal - Thomas Harris</h2>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t like Hannibal nearly as much as the previous books in the series. The novel starts off strong with a new form of narrative than the previous two. It has a nice plot with Agent Starling dealing with the bureaucracy of the bureau and a drug bust gone awry. Then we get to the what you hope would be the good part; the hunt for Hannibal Lecter.. This entertains for awhile, but eventually it decays to recycling old lines from Silence of the Lambs. But the worst part is the ending, where Agent Starling for some reasons abandons all her morals and actual character development to become Lecter’s lover and fellow cannibal. It just doesn’t add up with what we know about her up to that point. This novel decays to a point where it reads more like fan fiction than an actual addition to the series. 5.5/10 </p>		
<h2>Death's End - Cixin Liu</h2>
<p>Death’s End is probably the weakest member of the Remembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy. It has a problem in that it takes about half the book to set up the a plot that is riddled with scientific errata. If you can warp spacetime then why can you only create negative curvature? Even granted this, once everywhere is warped equally it should return to being flat and no longer have diminished light speed as opposed to having diminished light speed everywhere. Also if you warp spacetime it should have an associated acceleration which the “black domains” don’t seem to. But perhaps the most annoying is that the whole point of warp field drives is that they allow you to travel across space while avoiding speciall relativistic constraints, but Cixin Liu wanted to have the times experienced be different so he ignores this or simply didn't do his research. It also doesn’t help that the ending of the second book is probably a better ending overall than the ultimate one. Overall it is still a neat story and involves some entertaining narrative devices. 6.5/10</p>
<h2>The Silence of the Lambs - Thomas Harris</h2>
<p>Silence of the Lambs is the sequel to Red Dragon in the Hannibal Lecter Series. It is told in the same fashion as the original, and introduces the compelling new character Clarice Starling. It is a very well made book, but based on the quality of its film adaptation I’m not even sure if reading it added anything new. 7.5/10</p>
<h2>The Dark Forest - Cixin Liu</h2>
<p>The Dark Forest is a powerful sequel to the Three-Body problem that, if anything, outshines its predecessor. It weaves an enthralling and well thought out plot that never ceases to engage the reader. It also becomes beautifully clear how the author’s plot lends itself to avoid the foibles of some science fiction, such as the obvious underestimate of human technological growth due to jumps in scientific theory. I don’t know what the future hold for the Remembrance of Earth’s Past series, but given the right opportunity it could certainly rise to the rank of classic among those series as Foundation. 8/10</p>	
<h2>All the Birds in the Sky - Charlie Jane Anders</h2>
<p>It is no wonder that this book won this year’s Nebula Award for best novel. Not only is it a wonderfully crafted and beautifully self-contained narrative, but its interplay between magic and technology underscore and combine the genres of fantasy and science fiction into one cohesive novel. It is exactly what the Nebula Awards seek to represent. Very few authors are able to intertwine these two genres without lapsing into inconsistency. Anders is able to easily separate the two realms without losing the marvel of either.  8/10</p>
<h2>Red Dragon - Thomas Harris</h2>
<p>Red Dragon is the novel that launched the Hannibal Lecter franchise. It introduces Lecter as a character through a thrilling story of the investigation into another serial killer told from the perspective of the investigator who caught Lector. It is a very well formulated narrative with frighteningly developed and depicted characters. It has the intrigue of the Sherlock Holmes, super-policeman genre but shows the thought process of the detective which eliminates some the preposterous conclusions so often drawn in Sherlock Holmes and similar novels. What really makes this book is its characters. 7.5/10</p>
<h2>Who Goes There? - John W. Campbell</h2>
<p>Who Goes There is the science fiction novella that was the influence for the classic film, The Thing. It tells the thrilling story of an alien encounter in an Antarctic research base. It is a story that is not only well formulated but also sparked a genera trope that always makes for a thrilling story. There is no surprise that it has become a science fiction classic. 7.5/10</p>
<h2>A Little History of the World - Ernst Gombrich</h2>
<p>A Little History of the World is a nice overview of much of world history. It is very Eurocentric and deals only marginally with eastern cultures, Russia, and Native American cultures. The information it contains is material everyone should learn at some point to be members of the modern world. It is targeted at younger readers but should not be limited to them. The book does reveal some of its author’s biases and perspectives at times, but overall these aren’t harmful views. It is a book that was originally written in six weeks by a man who had no job and a degree in art history, but was well enough written to build him a career. That alone should be impetus enough to read this book. On top of that it is a book that was banned by the Nazis for having too “pacifistic” a view of history. 7/10</p>
<h2>The Three-Body Problem - Cixin Liu</h2>
<p>The Three-Body Problem is a well written and well formulated narrative that tells an interesting and original take on the first contact between humans and aliens. Cixin Liu clearly found a third, less intuitive answer to the question of how we would prevent ourselves from being invaded. I do have some qualms about minutia in the book, chiefly that the proposed “three-body problem” is actually a four-body problem. I also don’t fully understand why the aliens care about solving the problem if their civilization will be destroyed either way. There also seems to be a slight misunderstanding of what it means for the three-body problem to be “unsolvable” actually means. The aliens could definitely have used supercomputers to simulate where the suns were going to be. With good initial conditions and an updating plot of where the suns are it wouldn’t have been that big a problem. As a whole, it was a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hard science fiction. 7.5/10</p>
<h2>The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice - Christopher Hitchens</h2>
<p>When we hear about Mother Teresa, we usually are usually described a wondrous woman with little to no flaws. After all she is a saint. This is the untold story of a woman who used her position as a religious leader and missionary for ill wrought gains. That is not to say that she was not an incredible person, but after reading this book, it is clear that she is in fact human. Some of the more questionable of her actions include preaching poverty while taking in millions into private bank accounts, and putting the image and wellbeing of the church before that of the poor. 7/10</p>
<h2>The Master and Margarita - Mikhail Bulgakov</h2>
<p>The Master and Margarita is based on a fairly simple premise. What would happen if the devil came to the religion free world of the Soviet Union? What ensues is a masterwork of Russian absurdism filled with consummate wit and superb storytelling. It is the best book I have read this year. What makes M&M even more appealing is that it was banned in the USSR and only allowed to be published decades after it was written. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if they were interested in the absurdity of life, religion, and the Soviet Union. 9/10</p>
<h2>Breakfast of Champions - Kurt Vonnegut</h2>
<p>In standard Vonnegut style, Breakfast of Champions is a wacky but impressive world that contains wonderfully absurd characters and fourth-wall breaking impressive narrative. I very much enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to anyone as an example of Vonnegut at his best. 8.5/10</p>
<h2>Letters to a Young Contrarian - Christopher Hitchens</h2>
<p>Christopher Hitchens is perhaps the greatest writer of the past generation. I find it incredibly sad that most people will never be able to appreciate this due to his content and perspective. His use of language and oratory is unparalleled by the vast majority of writers but his avid atheism alienates him from the masses. This book, although it does touch on his religious view, it is mostly about his political worldview. I think he has a rational and logically consistent perspective that continues to intrigue me. 8/10</p>
<h2>The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love - Oscar Hijuelos</h2>
<p>This Pulitzer Prize winning novel was an interesting look into the world of Cuban music in the 50’s. Although it could be more aptly titled “The Mambo Kings Have Lots of Graphic Sex,” the book did have a very interesting narrative form and format. We are shown the retrospective life of a mambo musician in scattered nonconsecutive flashbacks. It is a book which was well written and fairly enjoyable but wouldn’t be on the top of my recommendations list. 7/10</p>
<h2>Siddhartha - Hermann Hesse</h2>
<p>Siddhartha was a great journey through the semiautobiographical tale of a young monk named Siddhartha who is also Herman Hesse incarnate in the time of the Buddha. It was a very enjoyable read by someone who saw the world as a place that pushes us towards extremes. It was a short book but contained the wisdom of a much longer novel. 8.5/10</p>
<h2>The Sun Also Rises - Ernest Hemingway</h2>
<p>The Sun Also Rises is a nice vantage into the midlife crisis and regretted life of a man in Europe in between the world wars. It was definitely a well-made and realistic look into the world it described. I have never heard the callous slaughter of animals for gladiatorial entertainment so romantically portrayed. 7.5/10</p>
<h2>The Diary of the Rose - Ursula K. Le Guin</h2>
<p>The Diary of the Rose is an engaging story about a psychologist who uses a device that allows her to see the thoughts of her patients. She is given a patient who is said to be paranoid but it becomes increasingly evident that he is more likely institutionalized for dissenting political views. It was a fun read and a fun, if not haunting subject. 7/10</p>
<h2>The 48 Laws of Power - Robert Greene</h2>
<p>This book was given to me as a gift and I read it for that reason. Let’s set aside the obvious moral decrepitude of this book. It was made to be strategy guide to benefit a person at all costs. It never intended to be moral. We can also to some extent ignore the fact that many of the rules are blatantly self-contradictory as it also claims that adaptability, or “fluidity” is key, (although if this is the case then it really downplays the so-called “laws” to little more than extremely situational advice). The overall tone of the book seems to support two completely different worldviews. It seems to say that you should try to both play the system, and strive to be a subservient part of the system. I would call the book Machiavellian if it wasn’t so insecure and misinformed. In general, I think the worst thing about the book is this: Consider the person who holds all these “laws” as true; an ostentatious, self-important sycophant who contributes as little as possible and tries to claim and cling to the work and success of others. Now ask yourself; is this person someone you admire? Someone you would get along with or even want to encounter? Is this someone you would hire or promote in an organization? If the answer is yes I am sorry for you, but for most people, these are all red flags that won’t bring anyone success or “power” so much as the distain of others and inevitable failure for the vast majority of endeavors. 2.5/10</p>
<h2>Finnegans Wake - James Joyce</h2>
<p>I think that at some point James Joyce went terribly insane and people just kept maintaining that he was a genius even though his mind was gone. It’s hard to tell though, because he was a pioneer of creative writing techniques, especially stream of consciousness. Finnegans Wake is a… story? But the most notable feature of this work is Joyce’s stylistic choice to write the book in gibberish. Joyce claimed that this was the work he could rest his reputation on, and so people maintain that it is great. To be fair, the book does have some very interesting and witty sentences, or more often sentence fragments, but I also don’t think it is unreasonable to expect a book to be decipherable. If anyone who wasn’t already a famous author was to write this book it almost certainly wouldn’t be published, and I’m not sure why we don’t hold Joyce to the same standard. 4/10</p>
<h2>The Backward Shadow - Lynne Reid Banks</h2>
<p>This was a fun and at times, incredibly sad sequel to the L-Shaped Room. It didn’t have quite the same level of social analysis as the earlier book it was still a window into the culture of 50-60’s England. This book still did have some of the casual racial stereotyping that is probably a product of the era. Again, since we are seeing this world through the eyes of a contemporary character it in some ways makes the narrative more characteristic of the times. Lynne Reid banks herself sees it as shocking that she could have written them, which shows how much society seems to have progressed.  7.5/10</p>
<h2>The Pennsylvania Hermit - Amos Wilson</h2>
<p>The Pennsylvania Hermit is a two part book about Amos Wilson (sometimes called William). The first part is the story of his background. His sister was publically executed even as he was bringing a pardon to the execution. She was then gibbeted for some reason. He then became a sort of Christian ascetic. He lived in a cave outside of Harrisburg for 19 years and gave up all of his possessions. The second section of the book is Wilson’s manifesto called “The Sweets of Solitude” in which he describes the age old conclusion that suffering is caused by selfish desire and so the solution is to give up our worldly objects and live in a cave. 7/10</p>

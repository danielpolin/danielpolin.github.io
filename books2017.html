<p>These are the books I read in 2017. Please feel free to read my reviews and let me know if you have any comments, critiques, or recommendations. I'd be happy to discuss them with you.</p>
<h2>The Master and Margarita - Mikhail Bulgakov</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>The Sun Also Rises - Ernest Hemingway</h2>
<p>The Sun Also Rises is a nice vantage into the midlife crisis and regretted life of a man in Europe in between the world wars. It was definitely a well-made and realistic look into the world it described. I have never heard the callous slaughter of animals for gladiatorial entertainment so romantically portrayed. 7.5/10</p>
<h2>The Diary of the Rose - Ursula K. Le Guin</h2>
<p>The Diary of the Rose is an engaging story about a psychologist who uses a device that allows her to see the thoughts of her patients. She is given a patient who is said to be paranoid but it becomes increasingly evident that he is more likely institutionalized for dissenting political views. It was a fun read and a fun, if not haunting subject. 7/10</p>
<h2>The 48 Laws of Power - Robert Greene</h2>
<p>This book was given to me as a gift and I read it for that reason. Let’s set aside the obvious moral decrepitude of this book. It was made to be strategy guide to benefit a person at all costs. It never intended to be moral. We can also to some extent ignore the fact that many of the rules are blatantly self-contradictory as it also claims that adaptability, or “fluidity” is key, (although if this is the case then it really downplays the so-called “laws” to little more than extremely situational advice). The overall tone of the book seems to support two completely different worldviews. It seems to say that you should try to both play the system, and strive to be a subservient part of the system. I would call the book Machiavellian if it wasn’t so insecure and misinformed. In general, I think the worst thing about the book is this: Consider the person who holds all these “laws” as true; an ostentatious, self-important sycophant who contributes as little as possible and tries to claim and cling to the work and success of others. Now ask yourself; is this person someone you admire? Someone you would get along with or even want to encounter? Is this someone you would hire or promote in an organization? If the answer is yes I am sorry for you, but for most people, these are all red flags that won’t bring anyone success or “power” so much as the distain of others and inevitable failure for the vast majority of endeavors. 2.5/10</p>
<h2>Finnegans Wake - James Joyce</h2>
<p>I think that at some point James Joyce went terribly insane and people just kept maintaining that he was a genius even though his mind was gone. It’s hard to tell though, because he was a pioneer of creative writing techniques, especially stream of consciousness. Finnegans Wake is a… story? But the most notable feature of this work is Joyce’s stylistic choice to write the book in gibberish. Joyce claimed that this was the work he could rest his reputation on, and so people maintain that it is great. To be fair, the book does have some very interesting and witty sentences, or more often sentence fragments, but I also don’t think it is unreasonable to expect a book to be decipherable. If anyone who wasn’t already a famous author was to write this book it almost certainly wouldn’t be published, and I’m not sure why we don’t hold Joyce to the same standard. 4/10</p>
<h2>The Backward Shadow - Lynne Reid Banks</h2>
<p>This was a fun and at times, incredibly sad sequel to the L-Shaped Room. It didn’t have quite the same level of social analysis as the earlier book it was still a window into the culture of 50-60’s England. This book still did have some of the casual racial stereotyping that is probably a product of the era. Again, since we are seeing this world through the eyes of a contemporary character it in some ways makes the narrative more characteristic of the times. Lynne Reid banks herself sees it as shocking that she could have written them, which shows how much society seems to have progressed.  7.5/10</p>
<h2>The Pennsylvania Hermit - Amos Wilson</h2>
<p>The Pennsylvania Hermit is a two part book about Amos Wilson (sometimes called William). The first part is the story of his background. His sister was publically executed even as he was bringing a pardon to the execution. She was then gibbeted for some reason. He then became a sort of Christian ascetic. He lived in a cave outside of Harrisburg for 19 years and gave up all of his possessions. The second section of the book is Wilson’s manifesto called “The Sweets of Solitude” in which he describes the age old conclusion that suffering is caused by selfish desire and so the solution is to give up our worldly objects and live in a cave. 7/10</p>

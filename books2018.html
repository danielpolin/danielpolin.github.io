<p>These are the books I read in 2018. Please feel free to read my reviews and let me know if you have any comments, critiques, or recommendations. I'd be happy to discuss them with you. In 2018 I have been won over by the Michelin Star rating system and will be adopting it for future ratings. One star * signifies a quality book. Two stars ** is a great, nearly perfect book. Three stars *** means it is a top tier book.</p>
		
		<h2>Swann's Way - Marcel Proust</h2>
		<h2>The Lathe of Heaven - Ursula K. LeGuin ***</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h2>Throne of Jade - Naomi Novic *</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h2>Artemis - Andy Weir **</h2>
		<p>I’m not sure if Andy Weir actually sets out to write stories, or simply fantasizes about people dying in space and weaves narrative around it. Whatever the case he is great at what he does. He has a wonderful style and uses it to create personal and complex characters that really drive the narrative. His attention to detail and scientific acumen really transform what could be a broad fantasy into what feels like real life. Artemis tells the story of the first city on the moon and the socioeconomic structure therein. It is a great piece of science fiction.</p>
		<h2>Bilbo’s Last Song - J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
		<p>It's a short poem that serves as an unnecesary filler at the end of Lord of the Rings. Bilbo sails west. The end.</p>
		<h2>Let’s Explore Diabetes with Owls - David Sedaris *</h2>
		<p>All of David Sedaris’ books are all wonderful reads. He is simply a great essayist. I especially enjoy about how he writes of his neuroses and how he views them shape his writing.</p>

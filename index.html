                                    <p>I am a first year physics PhD graduate student at <a href="http://physics.ucdavis.edu/" title="" target="_blank"> UC Davis</a>. I am part of <a href="http://tyson.ucdavis.edu/" title="" target="_blank"> Tyson Group</a> working in experimental Cosmology and Astrophysics with <a href="http://physics.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/anthony-tyson" title="" target="_blank"> Professor Tony Tyson</a>, where I work in the LSST CCD Lab. </br></br>In the past I was involved in a number of research fields. These include high energy particle physics with <a href="http://physics.as.nyu.edu/object/AllenMincer.html" title="" target="_blank"> Prof. Allen Mincer</a> at NYU's <a href="http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/" title="" target="_blank"> ATLAS Lab</a>, and theoretical density functional theory with <a href="http://www.phys.subr.edu/physicscurrent/faculty/bagayoko/" target="_top">Prof. Diola Bagayoko.</a> I also conducted a study into the Kolmogorov complexity of the unary numerical system under the hyperoperations. For more about specifics in my research please see my curriculum vitae.</br></br>On another, less physics related note, I am also trying to analyse the roles of women in 20th century science fiction literature to try and evaluate how the percieved role of women in an ideal or futuristic society has changed over time. I am mainly limiting my study to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_joint_winners_of_the_Hugo_and_Nebula_awards" title="" target="_blank"> joint winners of the Hugo and Nebula Awards</a>.</p>

					<p>These are my reviews of some of the books I've read. Please feel free to read them and let me know if you have any comments, critiques, or recommendations. I'd be happy to discuss them with you. My rating system is styled in the fashion of the Michelin Star system.</p>
					<p>One Star * A very good book in its category</p>
					<p>Two stars ** Excellent book, worth a detour</p>
					<p>Three stars *** Exceptional book, worth a special journey.</p>
					<p>If the book does not receive a star, that is not a mistake, it simply doesn't rank.</p>

				    <h2>Charlie Jane Anders</h2>
					<h4>All the Birds in the Sky**</h4>
					<p>It is no wonder that this book won this year’s Nebula Award for best novel. Not only is it a wonderfully crafted and beautifully self-contained narrative, but its interplay between magic and technology underscore and combine the genres of fantasy and science fiction into one cohesive novel. It is exactly what the Nebula Awards seek to represent. Very few authors are able to intertwine these two genres without lapsing into inconsistency. Anders is able to easily separate the two realms without losing the marvel of either.</p>
				</div>    
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Isaac Asimov</h2>
					<h4>The End of Eternity**</h4>
					<p>The End of Eternity is a pretty solid standalone novel and also can be seen as tying into Asimov’s larger galactic empire universe. However, this universe does seem to have sentient life other than that of Earth, whereas the Galactic Empire universe does not. It chronicles the adventure of a single member of the collective timeline enforcement agency known as “Eternity.” The story follows the ark of an individual member of this society as he attempts to serve his community without compromising his humanity. I think this story has an interesting take on time travel and the dynamics thereof and is worth reading based on this alone. If we do ever discover a means of time travel I think we will inevitably form some type of policing system like Eternity to alter the timeline if that is possible.</p>
					<h4>Nightfall and Other Stories*</h4>		
					<p>Nightfall and Other Stories was is home to the story that gave Asimov his start. I made the choice to read the novelization first. I’m not sure if that was a mistake. The other stories were also delightful.</p>			
					<h4>Nine Tomorrows*</h4>		
					<p>Nine Tomorrows is a short story collection that has some of the greats. Among these are The Last Question and The Ugly Little Boy. There are some great stories in here.</p>
					
					<h3>Galactic Empire Series</h3>
					<h4>Pebble in the Sky**</h4>
					<p>Pebble in the Sky is the first written and third chronologically of Asimov’s Galactic Empire series. I definitely recommend reading them in the order they were written. This is the best of the series. Every time I read Asimov I remember why I love his work. Pebble in the Sky tells a story in the time of the Galactic Empire. It manages to bridge this gap with a character who is transported from present day earth to a time when modern life has become the imprecise subject of anthropology.</p>
					<h4>The Stars Like Dust</h4>
					<p>The Stars Like Dust wasn’t as enjoyable as Pebble. This second book in the Galactic Empire series had some issues. It was usually difficult to determine why you should be supporting the heroes over the villains. The story itself was fine but it had very corny and cliché reveals.</p>
					<h4>The Currents of Space</h4>
					<p>The Currents of Space is the last in the Galactic empire series. It is set before the formation of the Empire but after Trantor began to rise. Again, I don’t understand why I should support either side. It also has some outdated science but it wasn’t at the time so we can give it some slack for that.</p>

				    <h2>Margaret Atwood</h2>
					<h4>The Handmaid's Tale**</h4>
					<p>The Handmaid’s Tale was a well crafted novel that rekindles the feeling of reading 1984 for the first time. It is a dystopia told from the perspective of a woman in a religious breeding camp. The novel does give us a certain level of closure that we never got in other Orwellian works. That is we are told afterwards that the rest of the world still exists, that there is still hope that the dystopia ends in time.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Marcus Aurelius</h2>
					<h4>Meditations**</h4>
					<p>I really enjoy the stoics. This is a book filled with wisdom, insight into the lost world of roman times, and shrewd satire that transcends its moment in history.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Lynne Reid Banks</h2>
					<h4>The L-Shaped Room***</h4>
					<p>Lynne Reid Banks is one of the most realistic writers that I have encountered. Even when writing about the most fantasy subjects she still makes the characters act and feel like real people. This is the first adult novel I read by her and it is extremely well done. The L-Shaped Room is about a young, unmarried woman named Jane who becomes pregnant in the 1950’s. It is a very realistic telling that give great insight into the times and mores of its setting. The narrative doesn’t cut out the casual racism and antisemitism of the 50’s, although it is obviously told from a perspective that is in support of equality. It even somewhat supports homosexuality which wasn’t in vogue on the 50’s or early 1960 when the book was written. It does have some caricaturish depictions of race, but this is somewhat to be expected for the times and even somewhat excusable as we are seeing the world through the lens of a contemporary, Jane. This in particular is what makes the book great, the vantage of being inside Jane’s mind and her truly human interactions in a world that denigrates her.</p>
					<h4>The Backward Shadow**</h4>
					<p>This was a fun and at times, incredibly sad sequel to the L-Shaped Room. It didn’t have quite the same level of social analysis as the earlier book it was still a window into the culture of 50-60’s England. This book still did have some of the casual racial stereotyping that is probably a product of the era. Again, since we are seeing this world through the eyes of a contemporary character it in some ways makes the narrative more characteristic of the times. Lynne Reid banks herself sees it as shocking that she could have written them, which shows how much society seems to have progressed.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Jack Barsky</h2>
					<h4>Deep Undercover**</h4>
					<p>Deep Undercover was a biography that reads like a novel. Following the life of Jack Barsky was an engaging and suspenseful journey. He was a soviet spy who lived as an illegal spy in the US during the cold war. Although I don’t always agree with his opinions, his unique perspective and insights are definitely worth reading.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Ray Bradbury</h2>
					<h4>Fahrenheit 451*</h4>
					<p>Fahrenheit 451 was a little underwhelming. It is definitely an original and creative idea. The only problem is that I think it has permeated our society to the point that it wasn’t that interesting. Once you get past the premise most of the book is minutia.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Mikhail Bulgakov</h2>
					<h2>The Master and Margarita***</h2>
					<p>The Master and Margarita is based on a fairly simple premise. What would happen if the devil came to the religion free world of the Soviet Union? What ensues is a masterwork of Russian absurdism filled with consummate wit and superb storytelling. What makes M&M even more appealing is that it was banned in the USSR and only allowed to be published decades after it was written. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if they were interested in the absurdity of life, religion, and the Soviet Union.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>John W. Campbell</h2>
					<h4>Who Goes There?*</h4>
					<p>Who Goes There is the science fiction novella that was the influence for the classic film, The Thing. It tells the thrilling story of an alien encounter in an Antarctic research base. It is a story that is not only well formulated but also sparked a genera trope that always makes for a thrilling story. There is no surprise that it has become a science fiction classic.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Wu Cheng’en</h2>
                                    	<h4>Journey to the West***</h4>
					<p>I like to think that I had a decent education. In high school we had multiple courses called “World Civilizations.” But for some reason, no one ever mentioned the Four Great Classic Novels of China. We read a bunch of books with little to no historical significance, but the four didn’t make the cut. These are four novels that have had an incredible impact on Chinese culture, and I had never heard of them until I was introduced by one of college friends. Journey to the West is the story of a group of four creatures on a quest to retrieve holy scriptures from India. The most compelling character is a monkey king named Sun Wukong who is doing penance for painting himself as a sage worthy of heaven. It is a very impressive novel, and having read it, I understand a lot of cultural references that I previously had not.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Apostolos Doxiadis</h2>
					<h4>Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth*</h4>
					<p>Logicomix is a graphic novel exploration of the life and work of Bertrand Russell. I think that the format of the novel is well made and enjoyable to read. It uses a nested story narrative of the comic writers explaining their process of creating a story in which Bertrand Russell gives a talk about his life and views on passivism. I do think that the narrative does oversimplify the idea of mathematical rigor and incompleteness. I fear that many people may come away from the novel thinking that either math is completely self-consistent, or that it is completely disproven for practical implications. But despite this, and some historical inaccuracies, this book does a good job of explaining some difficult or traditionally convoluted topics at a level approachable to anyone.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Greg Egan</h2>
					<h4>The Clockwork Rocket</h4>
					<p>The Clockwork Rocket has a fairly simple premise: what if time acted just like any other dimension? Starting from there the book has its positives and negatives. Egan creates an interesting and thought provoking world that he used to evaluate pertinent issues like women’s rights, especially reproductive rights. But on the other hand he also often interrupts the narrative to give basic science lessons. I think it is one of the trademarks of good science fiction to have the world and all science involved to be discovered fluidly through story. If you ever have to stop the story to explain something science or background related then the narrative structure and the novel suffers. Unfortunately this book does this time and time again in a way that lacks fluidity. The book also focuses greatly on simple scientific ideas while leaving the actual science necessary to back up his world largely unexplained. Most distressingly, he fails to properly explain why he thinks changing a basic assumption of relativity, the non-constant speed of light, would have only the seemingly mundane changes he mentions. I also don’t understand why he believes his world would have a reversed form of time dilation when time dilation itself is based on the fixed speed of light. If time were just another dimension then we should logically only have Galilean transformations.</p>

				    <h2>Richard Feynman</h2>
					<h4>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman**</h4>
					<p>This book has become a sort of rite of passage for physics students, so I thought I would finally read it. It is an accumulation of the stories of renowned physicist Richard Feynman. Many of this are very entertaining and undoubtedly imagined to some degree, but what holds true is their reinforcement of Feynman’s views on education and creative thought which are definitely worth reading. It is also interesting to see what Feynman finds important in stories and what he chooses to keep and what to leave out.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Neil Gaiman</h2>
					<h4>Anansi Boys***</h4>
					<p>Anansi Boys was great. It’s Gaiman at his best. It is basically a sequel to American Gods that follows the son of one of its best characters. Very well developed narrative.</p>
					<h4>Fragile Things</h4>
					<p>Fragile things is a collection of stories. Some of Neil Gaiman’s stories almost seem like half baked thoughts that he jotted down and forgot to finish. Others were very interesting and enjoyable though. This is the first time I realized that other people are as upset as I am about Susan in The Last Battle.</p>
					<h4>The Graveyard Book*</h4>
					<p>The Graveyard Book is a creative and original story that I would have liked more if I had not previously read Neil Gaiman’s work. He has a number of themes and ideas that permeate his stories and often make his characters clones of those in other books. The idea of this book is great. The copied sections are good, which is why they are worth copying but it still gets to me.</p>
					<h4>Norse Mythology*</h4>
					<p>I never really knew that much about Norse Mythology. As a kid I always enjoyed reading about the Greek gods and their exploits, but my studies never went that far north. I really enjoyed Gaiman’s telling of the stories. I don’t know the originals but he obviously added his own creative flair.</p>
					<h4>Odd and the Frost Giants</h4>
					<p>It's a nice short story that combines Gaiman's love of all things norse with his artful storytelling.</p>
					<h4>The Sleeper and the Spindle</h4>
					<p>This is a retelling of the classic story of sleeping beauty but enough modern and intriguing changes to still be enjoyable to read.</p>
					<h4>Stardust**</h4>		
					<p>Stardust is another fine example of Gaiman great work. I saw the movie several years ago and was surprised howw overlooked it was. The book is definitely more adult and more intricate and well worth the read.<p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Ernst Gombrich</h2>
					<h4>A Little History of the World**</h4>
					<p>A Little History of the World is a nice overview of much of world history. It is very Eurocentric and deals only marginally with eastern cultures, Russia, and Native American cultures. The information it contains is material everyone should learn at some point to be members of the modern world. It is targeted at younger readers but should not be limited to them. The book does reveal some of its author’s biases and perspectives at times, but overall these aren’t harmful views. It is a book that was originally written in six weeks by a man who had no job and a degree in art history, but was well enough written to build him a career. That alone should be impetus enough to read this book. On top of that it is a book that was banned by the Nazis for having too “pacifistic” a view of history.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Robert Greene</h2>
					<h4>The 48 Laws of Power</h4>
					<p>Let’s set aside the obvious moral decrepitude of this book. It was made to be strategy guide to benefit a person at all costs. It never intended to be moral. We can also to some extent ignore the fact that many of the rules are blatantly self-contradictory as it also claims that adaptability, or “fluidity” is key, (although if this is the case then it really downplays the so-called “laws” to little more than extremely situational advice). The overall tone of the book seems to support two completely different worldviews. It seems to say that you should try to both play the system, and strive to be a subservient part of the system. I would call the book Machiavellian if it wasn’t so insecure and misinformed. In general, I think the worst thing about the book is this: Consider the person who holds all these “laws” as true; an ostentatious, self-important sycophant who contributes as little as possible and tries to claim and cling to the work and success of others. Now ask yourself; is this person someone you admire? Someone you would get along with or even want to encounter? Is this someone you would hire or promote in an organization? If the answer is yes I am sorry for you, but for most people, these are all red flags that won’t bring anyone success or “power” so much as the distain of others and inevitable failure for the vast majority of endeavors.</p>

				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Thomas Harris</h2>
					<h4>Red Dragon**</h4>
					<p>Red Dragon is the novel that launched the Hannibal Lecter franchise. It introduces Lecter as a character through a thrilling story of the investigation into another serial killer told from the perspective of the investigator who caught Lector. It is a very well formulated narrative with frighteningly developed and depicted characters. It has the intrigue of the Sherlock Holmes, super-policeman genre but shows the thought process of the detective which eliminates some the preposterous conclusions so often drawn in Sherlock Holmes and similar novels. What really makes this book is its characters.</p>
					<h4>The Silence of the Lambs*</h4>
					<p>Silence of the Lambs is the sequel to Red Dragon in the Hannibal Lecter Series. It is told in the same fashion as the original, and introduces the compelling new character Clarice Starling. It is a very well made book, but based on the quality of its film adaptation I’m not even sure if reading it added anything new.</p>
					<h4>Hannibal</h4>
					<p>Honestly, I didn’t like Hannibal. It simply doesn't stand up to the earlier books in the series. The novel starts off strong with a new form of narrative than the previous two. It has a nice plot with Agent Starling dealing with the bureaucracy of the bureau and a drug bust gone awry. Then we get to the what you hope would be the good part; the hunt for Hannibal Lecter.. This entertains for awhile, but eventually it decays to recycling old lines from Silence of the Lambs. But the worst part is the ending, where Agent Starling for some reasons abandons all her morals and actual character development to become Lecter’s lover and fellow cannibal. It just doesn’t add up with what we know about her up to that point. This novel decays to a point where it reads more like fan fiction than an actual addition to the series.</p>		
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Ernest Hemingway</h2>
					<h4>The Old Man and the Sea***</h4>
					<p>The Old Man and the Sea was a striking story about the struggle and futility of life. I really think that Hemingway really has a gift for subtle symbolism and in a realistic setting. I can't help but compare this book to the Alchemist and Of Mice and Men since I read them both recently. I think this book has a much more realistic and useful outlook on reality that the uselessly optimistic Alchemist. It is hard to pick favorites between the Old Man and the Sea and Of Mice and Men. I think the contrast is that the Old Man and the Sea deals with the struggles of life and Of Mice and Men deals with the futility of mortality and death.</p>
					<h4>The Sun Also Rises**</h4>
					<p>The Sun Also Rises is a nice vantage into the midlife crisis and regretted life of a man in Europe in between the world wars. It was definitely a well-made and realistic look into the world it described. I have never heard the callous slaughter of animals for gladiatorial entertainment so romantically portrayed.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Hermann Hesse</h2>
					<h4>Siddhartha***</h4>
					<p>Siddhartha was a great journey through the semiautobiographical tale of a young monk named Siddhartha who is also Herman Hesse incarnate in the time of the Buddha. It was a very enjoyable read by someone who saw the world as a place that pushes us towards extremes. It was a short book but contained the wisdom of a much longer novel.-</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Oscar Hijuelos</h2>
					<h4>The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love</h4>
					<p>This Pulitzer Prize winning novel was an interesting look into the world of Cuban music in the 50’s. Although it could be more aptly titled “The Mambo Kings Have Lots of Graphic Sex,” the book did have a very interesting narrative form and format. We are shown the retrospective life of a mambo musician in scattered nonconsecutive flashbacks. It is a book which was well written and fairly enjoyable but wouldn’t be on the top of my recommendations list.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Christopher Hitchens</h2>
					<h4>Letters to a Young Contrarian**</h4>
					<p>Christopher Hitchens is perhaps the greatest writer of the past generation. I find it incredibly sad that most people will never be able to appreciate this due to his content and perspective. His use of language and oratory is unparalleled by the vast majority of writers but his avid atheism alienates him from the masses. This book, although it does touch on his religious view, it is mostly about his political worldview. I think he has a rational and logically consistent perspective that continues to intrigue me.</p>
					<h4>The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice*</h4>
					<p>When we hear about Mother Teresa, we usually are usually described a wondrous woman with little to no flaws. After all she is a saint. This is the untold story of a woman who used her position as a religious leader and missionary for ill wrought gains. That is not to say that she was not an incredible person, but after reading this book, it is clear that she is in fact human. Some of the more questionable of her actions include preaching poverty while taking in millions into private bank accounts, and putting the image and wellbeing of the church before that of the poor.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Laura Ingalls Wilder</h2>
					<h4>Little House in the Big Woods**</h4>
					<p>I always really enjoyed the novel Farmer Boy as a child, but for some reason I never picked up its more famous siblings. When I started Little House in the Big Woods I immediately noticed the same charm and narrative form that made child me enjoy her writing. I look forward to reading the rest.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>N.K. Jemisin</h2>
					<h4>The Fifth Season**</h4>		
					<p>The Fifth Season if great. It’s not often that both the first and second book in a series win the Hugo. This, the first book slowly develops a complex and engaging plot over the course of three separate stories that all feed the same end. Beautifully constructed and wonderful to read.</p>		
					<h4>The Obelisk Gate</h4>
					<p>The Obelisk Gate is a good sequel to The Fifth season. It was as well formulated and structured as its predecessor, but it is just a continuation of the story that keeps it going but does not conclude anything. It’s important to the series.</p>
                                    	<h4>The Stone Sky*</h4>
					<p>I thought The Stone Sky was a well completed and necessary conclusion to the Broken Earth Trilogy. The series as a whole is a wonderful and original idea that doubles as a metaphor for oppression and racism. I really enjoyed reading this series and would recommend it to any fantasy reader.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>James Joyce</h2>
					<h4>Finnegans Wake</h4>
					<p>I think that at some point James Joyce went terribly insane and people just kept maintaining that he was a genius even though his mind was gone. It’s hard to tell though, because he was a pioneer of creative writing techniques, especially stream of consciousness. Finnegans Wake is a… story? But the most notable feature of this work is Joyce’s stylistic choice to write the book in gibberish. Joyce claimed that this was the work he could rest his reputation on, and so people maintain that it is great. To be fair, the book does have some very interesting and witty sentences, or more often sentence fragments, but I also don’t think it is unreasonable to expect a book to be decipherable. If anyone who wasn’t already a famous author was to write this book it almost certainly wouldn’t be published, and I’m not sure why we don’t hold Joyce to the same standard.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Ursula K LeGuin</h2>
					<h4>The Diary of the Rose*</h4>
					<p>The Diary of the Rose is an engaging story about a psychologist who uses a device that allows her to see the thoughts of her patients. She is given a patient who is said to be paranoid but it becomes increasingly evident that he is more likely institutionalized for dissenting political views. It was a fun read and a fun, if not haunting subject.</p>
					<h4>The Lathe of Heaven***</h4>
					<!--<p>
					This week I was finally motivated to read The Lathe of Heaven by Ursula K LeGuin and instantly regretted putting it off for so long. The reason for choosing this book now is sadly LeGuin’s death which, by virtue of her breadth of influence, is a loss that will echo throughout the literary community. The Lathe of Heaven is a great example of LeGuin's incredible ability to take the utterly fantastic and make it seem real and logically sound. Although she writes science fiction and fantasy, her style is such that every novel is a passionate character study. Where most sci-fi authors make due with crashing space ships together and the grandiose vulgarities of space opera, LeGuin is somehow able to take the more elegant, microscopic approach, and focus instead on the individual. In this way she is able to analyze complex moral dilemmas and place the reader in the middle; struggling to find the answers along with the characters. This novel in particular examines the idea of moral relativism in a story akin to the Ring of Gyges, on the scale of the universe, told through the approachable lens of a frail, struggling draftsman. LeGuin also reveals an almost prophetic intuition into what would be the prevailing issues a half century in the future as she examines the ideas of racial inequality and identity, the threat of war in the middle east, overpopulation, and even man-made, CO2 fueled climate change. LeGuin’s writing promises to provoke and challenge views in the way that great writing must. Her legacy is the direction that she drove science fiction in the last fifty years towards the thoughtful and introspective genre that it has become. Her work has and will continue to inspire generations of writers now more than ever as we look forward to an uncertain future with challenges yet to be discovered. So go out and read The Lathe of Heaven or any of the multitudes of her other work. I promise it wont disappoint.

				       <h3>The Hainish Cycle</h3>
					<h4>Rocannon's World</h4>
					<p>Rocannon’s World is the first book Le Guin ever published. It is a fun book that explores society by having an advanced spaceman wander a foreign world. It was enjoyable, but not quite on the level I’ve come to expect form Le Guin. It also starts a larger overarching plot that is more expanded in the later books. </p>
					<h4>Planet of Exile</h4>
					<p>Planet of Exile is the second book in the Hainish Cycle. I enjoyed it more than Rocannon’s World but not so much as some of her other novels. It expands a little more on the overarching galactic plot while having a nice self contained narrative.</p>
					<h4>City of Illusions</h4>
					<p>City of Illusions is the story of a displace man on a journey of self discovery. It expands much more on the plot of the League of Worlds and their enemy. It is also the first book in the Hainish Cycle that is based on Earth which had only been mentioned in passing beforehand.</p>
					<h4>The Dispossessed***</h4>
					<p>I thought that the Dispossessed was very successful in both its main plot and in the moral and philosophical conversation it was trying to create. It might be that I personally relate to the fact that the main character is a physicist, but it also is a pointed piece about types of government systems, their strengths and failures. It is called "An Ambiguous Utopia" because even when any one of the societies seems to be almost perfect, there are always shortcomings and for that reason a simple change in viewpoint could entirely change what you take away from this book. We also see how gender roles come into play in these societies. This is even more interesting when you consider that it is being written in 1974 by arguably the greatest female science fiction writer of all time.</p>

				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>C.S. Lewis</h2>
					<h4>The Screwtape Letters</h4>
					<p>I hate propaganda but I recognize the potential workmanship of its form. The Screwtape Letters are very cleverly crafted in that they are presented from the perspective of a demon advising his underlings on how to corrupt people. This therefore allows Lewis to say whatever he wants and rally Christianity behind a vaguely established common narrative. If Lewis makes a point through his devil’s advocate that the reader agrees with, then the reader can feel self assured because of the common opinion. If the reader disagrees with Lewis’ sometimes hypocritical, and often misogynistic viewpoints, they can be dismissed because they are presented from the viewpoint of a demon, and of course, demons are misleading and are obviously lying. It’s a very clever propaganda device to make Christians feel superior regardless of if they agree with the points made or not.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Cixin Liu</h2>
					<h4>The Three-Body Problem**</h4>
					<p>The Three-Body Problem is a well written and well formulated narrative that tells an interesting and original take on the first contact between humans and aliens. Cixin Liu clearly found a third, less intuitive answer to the question of how we would prevent ourselves from being invaded. I do have some qualms about minutia in the book, chiefly that the proposed “three-body problem” is actually a four-body problem. I also don’t fully understand why the aliens care about solving the problem if their civilization will be destroyed either way. There also seems to be a slight misunderstanding of what it means for the three-body problem to be “unsolvable” actually means. The aliens could definitely have used supercomputers to simulate where the suns were going to be. With good initial conditions and an updating plot of where the suns are it wouldn’t have been that big a problem. As a whole, it was a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hard science fiction.</p>
					<h4>The Dark Forest***</h4>
					<p>The Dark Forest is a powerful sequel to the Three-Body problem that, if anything, outshines its predecessor. It weaves an enthralling and well thought out plot that never ceases to engage the reader. It also becomes beautifully clear how the author’s plot lends itself to avoid the foibles of some science fiction, such as the obvious underestimate of human technological growth due to jumps in scientific theory. I don’t know what the future hold for the Remembrance of Earth’s Past series, but given the right opportunity it could certainly rise to the rank of classic among those series as Foundation.</p>	
					<h4>Death's End</h4>
					<p>Death’s End is the weakest member of the Remembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy. It has a problem in that it takes about half the book to set up the a plot that is riddled with scientific errata. If you can warp spacetime then why can you only create negative curvature? Even granted this, once everywhere is warped equally it should return to being flat and no longer have diminished light speed as opposed to having diminished light speed everywhere. Also if you warp spacetime it should have an associated acceleration which the “black domains” don’t seem to. But perhaps the most annoying is that the whole point of warp field drives is that they allow you to travel across space while avoiding speciall relativistic constraints, but Cixin Liu wanted to have the times experienced be different so he ignores this or simply didn't do his research. It also doesn’t help that the ending of the second book is probably a better ending than the ultimate one. Overall it is still a neat story and involves some entertaining narrative devices.</p>

				    <h2>Naomi Novic</h2>
					<h4>Priced to Sell</h4>
					<p>Priced to Sell is a short story that explores how the housing market in New York City in the alternative universes where mythological creatures and fictional personas are commonplace. It was a fun little excursion but really just opened up the world and then ended. It would be a great setting for a larger work but didn’t take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
					<h4>Rock Falls</h4>
					<p>Rock Falls has a great opportunity for character development and world building but declines to do so. It is a very short work about a villain in a world of superheros who has the power of empathy who believes his mission is to save the world in an ends justify the means sort of plan. This in itself would make a great novel, but here it is just an idea that needs to be more developed.</p>
					<h4>Seven Years From Home*</h4>
					<p>Seven Years from home is a nicely crafted, self contained story that has a lot to say about inter-cultural exchange and how perception shapes and reshapes reality. Very enjoyable.</p>
					<h4>Uprooted</h4>
					<p>I think one of the main hallmarks of a great fantasy novel is believability. A fantasy novel needs to make you believe that everything within a fanciful universe is convincing and seemingly rationally coherent. It must make the incredible seem credible. Uprooted does this splendidly. When reading this book you can believe in the magic in a way that I remember feeling when I read great works of fantasy like “A Wizard of Earthsea.” This book is also a coming of age story of a girl trying to make her own way in a world that clashes with and rejects the way she operates. In her journey we are led along the mystery of a dark, evil wood that is revealed as Agnieszka finds her own way and comes to accept and take advantage of her own unique talents.</p>
					<h3>Temeraire Series</h3>
					<h4>His Majesty's Dragon**</h4>
					<p>I very much enjoy Naomi Novik’s work. This series is an alternative, fantastic fiction where dragons coexist with humans set during the Napoleonic wars. His Majesty’s Dragon is the first in the Temeraire series. It has interesting characters and the setup for an intriguing world. My only worry is that the nine books in the series wont be enough.</p>
					<h4>Throne of Jade</h4>
					<p>Naomi Novik is a wonderfully thoughtful writer. This sequel to His Majesy’s dragon kept up the imaginative world of the series while expanding on the moral and philosophical questions that were hinted at. It also vastly grows the internal universe and the perspective of different peoples involved. This series promises to keep an exciting pace and put forth new ideas as it continues.</p>

				    <h2>Nnedi Okorafor</h2>
					<h4>Binti*</h4>
					<p>Binti was an entertaining story about race and cultural intermingling in a science fiction setting. It did not go in the direction I expected but that allowed it accomplish its intended goal in a quicker paced narrative.</p>

				    <h2>Ada Palmer</h2>
					<h4>Too Like the Lightning</h4>
					<p>This new and violent rendition of The Indian in the Cupboard takes place in a futuristic world where governments are replaced by voluntarily joined groups and corporations. Although it is a futuristic world, I have trouble calling this book science fiction. It is a fantasy novel taking place in the future, but without the adequate explanation of the times it fails to make the leap to attain the feasibility that Sci-Fi necessitates. What’s more, its ending is wholly unsatisfactory, as if has no conclusion or even the less acceptable cliff hanger. It was clearly purposefully designed to be an extremely intellectual novel, full of classical references and enlightenment philosophy. Sadly this comes off more as snobbish than intelligent, especially from the narrative viewpoint of the villain, Mycroft Canner. The world presented did have an interesting portrayal of gender, with the abolition of gendered pronouns. But again, the narrator uses gendered pronouns, and in such a way that they don’t apply to the actual sex of the character which obfuscates visualization of such characters. This is not a flaw of the book, it is an active choice of the author. Great title as well. Kurt Vonnegut liked to say that he wasn't a science fiction writer, he was a writer who understood science. This is the opposite; it is science fiction written by someone who does not understand science.</p>

				    <h2>Steve Perry</h2>
					<h4>Shadows of the Empire</h4>
					<p>Shadows of the Empire is the first, and likely last Star Wars novel I will read. It has relative renowned compared to others in the series because of the advertising, and accompanying soundtrack that they created for the novel. The basically made everything but the movie. The problem is that it is exactly what I expected from a Star Wars novel; that is, not very good, and basically parodying the franchise. It takes place in between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and as such they don’t have Han. Their solution, in stead of giving larger, developing roles to other characters, it to replace him with a cheap knockoff. They also choose to make Leia a side character who doesn’t have the same sense of command or cleverness from the series. Basically it seems like this book was made as a filler to make money, which it was.</p>

				    <h2>Philip Pullman</h2>
					<h4>La Belle Sauvage*</h4>
					<p>I often miss the world of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials. It is a wonderfully designed setting that really makes you sink into the reality of the story while retaining that feeling of strangeness and fascination. This is true not only in his broader strokes, but also in details like replacing "electric" with "amberic" and others that make you really wonder about how his world developed. This book is the first in what promises to be a new trilogy that preludes the original. It is definitely meant to be read after the original as it quickly expands on important plot points of its predecessors and keeps the audience enthralled with new ones. This book does go off the rails a bit in ways that, while not wholly inconsistent with the original trilogy, do bring up a lot of questions about the more metaphysical aspects of Lyra’s world.</p>

				    <h2>David Sedaris</h2>
					<h4>Let’s Explore Diabetes with Owls*</h4>
					<p>All of David Sedaris’ books are all wonderful reads. He is simply a great essayist. I especially enjoy about how he writes of his neuroses and how he views them shape his writing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Arkady and Boris Strugatsky</h2>
					<h4>The Dead Mountaineer's Inn</h4>
					<p>The Dead Mountaineer’s Inn is a true work of Russian absurdist science fiction. It is written in a way that there are constantly things happening but none of them really have any meaning. I think the best word to describe this book is, “bizarre.” It's well written, but bizarre.</p>
				</div>

				    <h2>J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
					<h4>Bilbo’s Last Song</h4>
					<p>It's a short poem that serves as an unnecesary filler at the end of Lord of the Rings. Bilbo sails west. The end.</p>
					<h4>The Lay of Aotrou & Itroun*</h4>
					<p>Tolkien writes beautifully. It doesn’t matter if he is creating a new world or simply unfurling a simple narrative. The man has a mastery of language. This is a poem about a married couple and their journey through trying to have a child. It is a magical background and set in beautifully crafted verse that explores old england where modern Christianity meets ancient paganism.</p>

				    <h2>Jeff VanderMeer</h2>
					<h4>Annihilation</h4>
					<p>Annihilation was a fun read. While reading it you are never really sure how reliable the narrator is. She might just as easily be hallucinating as accurately portraying reality. It was an excursion and a pretty original narrative.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Kurt Vonnegut</h2>
					<h4>Breakfast of Champions***</h4>
					<p>In standard Vonnegut style, Breakfast of Champions is a wacky but impressive world that contains wonderfully absurd characters and fourth-wall breaking impressive narrative. I very much enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to anyone as an example of Vonnegut at his best.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Steven Weinberg</h2>
					<h4>Dreams of a Final Theory*</h4>
					<p>This book is a great read for anyone who is interested in learning some of the problems of modern day physics. As with all of these types of books, it often falls beneath the scope of actual rigorous explanations, but it serves its purpose well.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-text margin-t-30">
				    <h2>Andy Weir</h2>
					<h4>The Egg**</h4>
					<p>The Egg is a very short story that quickly conveys and interesting idea. Very good idea with a very good execution.</p>
					<h4>Artemis**</h4>
					<p>I’m not sure if Andy Weir actually sets out to write stories, or simply fantasizes about people dying in space and weaves narrative around it. Whatever the case he is great at what he does. He has a wonderful style and uses it to create personal and complex characters that really drive the narrative. His attention to detail and scientific acumen really transform what could be a broad fantasy into what feels like real life. Artemis tells the story of the first city on the moon and the socioeconomic structure therein. It is a great piece of science fiction.</p>

				    <h2>Amos Wilson</h2>
					<h4>The Pennsylvania Hermit</h4>
					<p>The Pennsylvania Hermit is a two part book about Amos Wilson (sometimes called William). The first part is the story of his background. His sister was publically executed even as he was bringing a pardon to the execution. She was then gibbeted for some reason. He then became a sort of Christian ascetic. He lived in a cave outside of Harrisburg for 19 years and gave up all of his possessions. The second section of the book is Wilson’s manifesto called “The Sweets of Solitude” in which he describes the age old conclusion that suffering is caused by selfish desire and so the solution is to give up our worldly objects and live in a cave.</p>

				    <h2>Redwood and Pine Shelf</h2>
					<p>I decided I needed a shelf to hold the boardgames and such that I might have in the future. I designed a two-tone (pine and redwood) shelf and set to work. I added a drawer for all those things I might want to store in my living room. I had to make everything with hand tools as I still don't have access to the Davis machine shop. It might have been a little more precise if I had had a power saw, but I think it turned out alright.</p>
